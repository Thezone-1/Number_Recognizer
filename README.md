# Number_Recognizer
This repository contains a machine learning model for handwritten number recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 95% on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying handwritten digits.

# Introduction
Handwritten number recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of handwritten digits, commonly used as a benchmark for developing and testing image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this project, we have built a machine learning model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
